# TODO CA include core/lib

(it should be included....
from core/lib you must remove stuff that dont work on android)

Must be inlcuded with RELATIVE path.

## worse case: 
core/lib exports a jar, and include that jar (maybe from relative path)

## ideal:
core/lib  and android-new/lib will be published as gradle libraries at gradle/maven repos..
